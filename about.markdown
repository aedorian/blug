Trying to have a website with stuff in it

- [blug/](../index.html) is basically an archive of programming experiments I made. I'm trying to be concise and not go into the details too much, but I hope you can find something to learn in it.
- [links/](/blug/links/) is a list of web resources I found helpful or interesting.

About me? Currently a third year computer science bachelor at UJM, France. Feel free to contact me on Discord if you have any questions about anything here (my tag is `adridrian_`).

If you're interested here's a very secret link to my [portfolio](../_posts/2024-09-03-pf-jeux.html) (in french) in which more games and apps are showcased.

*Static website made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and an edited version of [riggraz's no style please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please/)*

*Post minimap largely based on [Preethi Sam's minimap](https://codepen.io/rpsthecoder/pen/Jwpxaj)*
