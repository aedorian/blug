## about

This is basically an archive of games or programming experiments I made.

I'm trying to be concise and not go into the details too much, but I hope you can find something to learn in it.

If you're interested here's a very secret link to my [portfolio](../_posts/2024-09-03-pf-jeux.html) (in french) in which more games and apps are showcased.

*Static website made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and an edited version of [riggraz's no style please theme](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please/)*
